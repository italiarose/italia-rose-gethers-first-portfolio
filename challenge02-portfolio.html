                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p> I was born and raised in the Lehigh Valley by a young mother in May of 2002. I spent much of my early life learning with my mom as she navigated the ups and downs single motherhood and her (one day) successful sales career, a journey which she'd begun at 18 years old with just a GED and lots of grit.</p> 
                    
                    <p>In June of 2020, I became the first in her family to graduate high school. While it had been established that I loved learning throughout my high school career as the co-president of my school's Social Justice Club and co-founder of a literacy mentorship program, the processes of developing an academic career remained elusive to me.</p>

                    <p> After a brief college search, I enrolled at Ithaca College in fall of 2020 as a double major in Writing for Film and Politics. I withdrew during fall of 2021 following a traumatic roll-over car accident. While recovering from my injuries and navigating the early stages of a PTSD diagnosis, I realized that I felt like I did not belong in my major or at my school. Determined to heal emotionally, I decided to begin searching for a path I felt I would enjoy as I began to embrace a lifestyle focusing on the practice of active love. My love for learning and creating led me to development.</p>

                    <p> My name is Italia Rose Gethers and I am learning to hold love within me while embracing the chaotic ways of life (and code). I look forward to creating with you.</p>
